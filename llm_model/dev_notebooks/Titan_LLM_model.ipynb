Never heard of these terms? That's because they are a thing of the past. These words are alive and well, however, in Forgotten English, a charming collection of hundreds of archaic words, their definitions, and old-fashioned line drawings. For readers of Bill Bryson, Henry Beard, and Richard Lederer, Forgotten English is an eye-opening trip down a delightful etymological path. Readers learn that an ale connor sat in a puddle of ale to judge its quality, that a beemaster informed bees of any important household events, and that our ancestors had a saint for hangover sufferers, St. Bibiana, a fact pertinent to the word bibulous. Each selection is accompanied by literary excerpts demonstrating the word's usage, from sources such as Shakespeare, Dickens, Chaucer, and Benjamin Franklin. Entertaining as well as educational, Forgotten English is a fascinating addition to word lovers' books.\",\n          \"A guide to personal finance for people over fifty covers such topics as stocks, insurance, annuities, tax-exempt bonds, long-term care, and real estate.\",\n          \"This classic text by Rudyard Kipling is a sequel to Puck of Pook's Hill.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"reviews\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 71646,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"torn between a redemptive vision of culture and a globalizing hegemony of the right, this is a splendid and pithy novel that unlocks the sublime visionary power of William Blake (as revolutionary figure) to do global work inside post-imperial Japan and the US/Anglo hegemony.

I love this novel, it taught me more about Blake and poetry than most poems I read, odd for a Japanese novelist to be tutoring this way!

God...Fairy Tale...Do these belong together in the same phrase?Ware tackles an issue long ignored by the Christian world: the truth that's inherent in myth and fable. He writes with clarity and beauty, shedding light on the lessons of life that pulse beneath the surface of numerous fairy tales. Not only does he give us deeper understanding of literary device and the original versions of many stories (for example, I was surprised by the real ending of &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot;), he helps us find spiritual meaning.&quot;God of the Fairy Tale&quot; is a book that even a kid could appreciate, but it resonates with richness and insight. With short, palatable chapters, Ware divvies out his ideas and leaves us enriched and enlivened in the process.

As a result, \\\"Islam: The Straight Path\\\" can be heartily recommended.Esposito introduces this religion, arguably the most important one for the West to understand at the present time, in plain and simple English. He outlines the history of the faith, from Muhammad through the early Caliphate and into the age of the great empires based on Islamic bedrock. He also explains the basic traditions and practices of Islam, while devoting considerable energy to explaining how the faith interacts with the modern world - an important concept for any serious study of religion.Unlike many introductory texts on Islam, Esposito does not trivialise certain points, such as the Shi'a tradition of succession to the prophet. Rather, he presents a balanced explanation of how the division between Sunni and Shi'a Islam came about - as well as demonstrating why the two groups are in fact much closer to each other than the media might try to claim. This is illustrative of his approach throughout this masterful work.Esposito comments early that he will avoid the diacritics so common in academic writing about Islam and the Arabic language. While this might dismay some specialists, it serves to \\\"de-alienise\\\" the concepts presented here - which is entirely the point.As a brief anecdote about the usefulness of this book, I first came across it on a booklist for a very introductory course on Islam I was taking. Since completing that course, I have moved into the field of Islamic Studies permanently and have never had this book out of my sight during research. Not only are Esposito's remarks on aspects of the faith very well-written, he also provides suggestions of other sources to consult.This book can be recommended to anyone keen to learn about Islam. Regardless of one's background knowledge or lack thereof, Esposito will prove a very useful addition to a bookshelf.

And what a plot! I was under the impression that these were completely dumbed down, G-rated kid-friendly books but there is a definite dark side to them. It's nothing that will give kids nightmares or anything, but it is a little creepy. I couldn't put it down I was so drawn in, and finished it easily the first day I got it. It's very hard to pull yourself away from. I think that if you are a parent you should read these books aloud to your children. Some of my most cherished childhood memories are my father reading to us, and this is the sort of book that we would have loved. You will enjoy it on your own, but I imagine that it would be a more fulfilling experience shared with the whole family.

They say the prince married a girl who was not what she appeared and that another girl who saved the kingdom vanished without a trace. Some said it was witchcraft. Some said it was only a legend. For those who knew the truth, it was magic.... Rescued from the sea at an early age, Pearl grew up within sight of the water...and the castle. With her pale skin and silvery hair, she was an outcast in the village. Her only friend was a boy she met on the beach -- a young prince named James, who understood Pearl's desire just to be like everyone else. Their friendship is viewed from afar by many: a disdainful king, Pearl's worried foster parents, a jealous young mermaid, a lovestruck merman, and the powerful sea witch. Now a storm brews in the kingdom, with a tidal force that could keep Pearl and James apart.\n",

He gazed up in envy at the greatest demonstration of paratroop power ever seen. Operation Market Garden, the plan to end the war by capturing the bridges leading to the Lower Rhine and beyond, was a bold concept: the Americans thought it unusually bold for Field Marshal Montgomery.

They say the prince married a girl who was not what she appeared and that another girl who saved the kingdom vanished without a trace. Some said it was witchcraft. Some said it was only a legend. For those who knew the truth, it was magic.... Rescued from the sea at an early age, Pearl grew up within sight of the water...and the castle. With her pale skin and silvery hair, she was an outcast in the village. Her only friend was a boy she met on the beach -- a young prince named James, who understood Pearl's desire just to be like everyone else. Their friendship is viewed from afar by many: a disdainful king, Pearl's worried foster parents, a jealous young mermaid, a lovestruck merman, and the powerful sea witch. Now a storm brews in the kingdom, with a tidal force that could keep Pearl and James apart.\n",
            "- **Top Review:** It all began one day when a fisherman rescued a little girl out of a storm. With no clue as to who she was or where she came from, the fisherman and his wife decided to raise her as their own.Pearl grows into a beautiful, but unusual young woman who is shunned and often feared by the other villagers. The only person who seems to understand her is a handsome young man she has been secretly meeting on the beach since childhood, James.The two begin to wonder if they may have something more than friendship between them, but their different social stations seem to stand in their way. Pearl and James' love seems doomed, until a mysterious stranger appears and changes everything.A very romantic and unique fairytale retelling. One of the best in the series.
