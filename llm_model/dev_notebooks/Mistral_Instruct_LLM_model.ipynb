For readers of Bill Bryson, Henry Beard, and Richard Lederer, Forgotten English is an eye-opening trip down a delightful etymological path. Readers learn that an ale connor sat in a puddle of ale to judge its quality, that a beemaster informed bees of any important household events, and that our ancestors had a saint for hangover sufferers, St. Bibiana, a fact pertinent to the word bibulous. Each selection is accompanied by literary excerpts demonstrating the word's usage, from sources such as Shakespeare, Dickens, Chaucer, and Benjamin Franklin.

Harmetz writes with warmth about nearly everyone involved in the film except Jack Warner, about whom she writes with a deserved respect. The stories of the bit players, most refugees, expanded the Casablanca context tremendously for me. The suspense, and the tale of how this gem could have been different in so many ways (or not produced at all), made me appreciate this cultural icon even more. I haven't seen the film since reading this book, but you bet when I do I'm going to turn off the phone.

Already on the shore are Jason and the Argonauts preparing to continue sailing in order to take the Golden Fleece from King Aeetes. Proteus decides to join the quest and performs feats beyond that of the heroes of the Argo.As Proteus begins to regains pieces of his memory, he concludes that King Pelias hired him to kill Jason. However, his time amidst the Argonauts, especially the brave leader makes him realize he cannot do this task and instead becomes an intrepid and loyal member of the crew. After fleecing Aeetes and other adventures, the Argonauts land on the enchantress Circe's island where Proteus not only learns more about himself and the truth, but plans to do something about it, that is if he lives long enough to do so.This retelling of the Greek epic Jason and the Argonauts is a well-written fantasy tale that keeps reader attention throughout the book. The story line is fast-paced and filled with action though much is seen through the eyes of the mysterious and bewildered Proteus as opposed to Jason, Hercules, and some of the other mythical heroes. Highly regarded Fred Saberhagen, in his fourth &#65533;BOOK OF THE GODS&#65533; novel, is not quite on the level of the mythological classic or the Ray Harryhausen animated enhanced movie, but will provide the author&#65533;s myriad of fans with an entertaining story.Harriet Klausner (Score: 5, Helpful: 2)\",\n          \"Many books these days claim to give readers \\\"a true depiction,\\\" of Islam, but most of them fail to live up to their promise. \\\"Islam:The Straight Path,\\\" is an exception to that rule.Esposito's book is the most objective overview on Islamic beliefs published, and is required reading for any one who wants to understand prevalent beliefs and virtues held in esteem, embraced and practiced by Islamic societies in countries across the world - not only where Islam is the dominant religion, but also in countries such as the US and UK where Islam is a religion of a minority. Esposito highlights how the interpretation and articulation of values may differ depending on cultural settings.This book is often a standard core text for survey courses on Islamic societies, Islamic history and basic relgion courses for good reason.

Tempting Fate is an unforgettable, enthralling novel about the risks and rewards of \"having it all\" from beloved New York Times bestselling author Jane Green. Gabby and Elliott have been happily married for eighteen years. They have two daughters. They have a beautiful, loving home. Forty-three-year-old Gabby is the last person to have an affair. She can't relate to the way her friends desperately try to cling to the beauty and allure of their younger years. And yet she too knows her youth is quickly slipping away. She could never imagine how good it would feel to have a handsome younger man show interest in her...until the night it happens. Matt makes Gabby feel sparkling, fascinating, alive—something she hasn't felt in years. What begins as a long-distance friendship soon develops into an emotional affair. Intoxicated, she has no choice but to step ever deeper into the allure of attraction and attention, never foreseeing the life-changing consequences that lie ahead. If she makes one wrong move, she could lose everything—and find out what really matters most.\n",

This special anniversary edition includes a new introduction and commentary by author Gary Paulsen, pen-and-ink illustrations by Drew Willis, and a water resistant cover. Hatchet has also been nominated as one of America's best-loved novels by PBS's The Great American Read. Thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson, haunted by his secret knowledge of his mother's infidelity, is traveling by single-engine plane to visit his father for the first time since the divorce. When the plane crashes, killing the pilot, the sole survivor is Brian. He is alone in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but his clothing, a tattered windbreaker, and the hatchet his mother had given him as a present. At first consumed by despair and self-pity, Brian slowly learns survival skills—how to make a shelter for himself, how to hunt and fish and forage for food, how to make a fire—and even finds the courage to start over from scratch when a tornado ravages his campsite. When Brian is finally rescued after fifty-four days in the wild, he emerges from his ordeal with new patience and maturity, and a greater understanding of himself and his parents.\n",

            "- **Top Review:** This book, the fifth in the series about the vampire Franz Ragozy de Saint Germain, was originally intended to be the last of the series. (It says so, in the \"about the author\" section in the back.) Of course, there are roughly a dozen more out now; Yarbro keeps getting new ideas for the character, beyond what she'd originally planned. This is unquestionably the best written of the first five books in the series, but be warned: do not read it unless you are in the mood for tragedy. It is powerfully written, and captures all too fully the trauma that struck all too frequently in that time and place; \"The Sound Of Music\" this most assuredly is NOT. (\"Hotel Transylvania\" was set in prerevolutionary France, \"The Palace\" in renaissance Italy in the time of Botticelli, \"Blood Games\" in imperial Rome at the time of Nero, and \"Path of the Eclipse\" during the Mongol invasion of China; this is set primarily in Germany during the period between the world wars.)There is little of the feel, all too evident in the first three books of the series, of the cheap Gothic Romance; the characters are very real, and so are the events (in at least two cases, a little TOO real for my taste, but I can't reasonably fault the author for that; the setting and period would not have been done justice had everything turned out well.)For those unfamiliar with the series, the Comte de Saint Germain is a vampire who has \"lived\" since approximately 1500 BC; he has many of the typical features of the stereotypical vampire; he doesn't age, is difficult to injure, and needs to drink blood to survive. But unlike the stereotype, he doesn't kill with his blood-drinking, and blood itself is not sufficient; there must be an emotional connection as well, and the less emotional connection there is, the less satisfying the blood is. He can be killed by severing the spine or destroying the brain; other wounds are painful, but ultimately superficial. He is susceptable to sunlight, but less so than many vampires; he doesn't care for it, but hardly bursts into flame on exposure. Essentially, he sunburns easily. Similarly, he cannot rest unless it is on his native soil, and cannot cross running water. All of these prohibitions, however, are alleviated by the expedient of wearing his native soil in the soles of his shoes, using it in the foundation of any home he builds, and filling his mattress with it, so he CAN, in fact, be seen in broad daylight in the Mediterranean summer on shipboard.The character is an unmitigated hero, not the antihero of most vampire fiction; wealthy, urbane, kind, generous, most worthy of emulation. Still, he's a bad man to cross. The series as a whole is highly recommended, and this book is powerfully written, if EXTREMELY unsettling. (Score: 5, Helpful: 5)\n",
