They say the prince married a girl who was not what she appeared and that another girl who saved the kingdom vanished without a trace. Some said it was witchcraft. Some said it was only a legend. For those who knew the truth, it was magic.... Rescued from the sea at an early age, Pearl grew up within sight of the water...and the castle. With her pale skin and silvery hair, she was an outcast in the village. Her only friend was a boy she met on the beach -- a young prince named James, who understood Pearl's desire just to be like everyone else. Their friendship is viewed from afar by many: a disdainful king, Pearl's worried foster parents, a jealous young mermaid, a lovestruck merman, and the powerful sea witch. Now a storm brews in the kingdom, with a tidal force that could keep Pearl and James apart.\n- **Top Review:** It all began one day when a fisherman rescued a little girl out of a storm. With no clue as to who she was or where she came from, the fisherman and his wife decided to raise her as their own.Pearl grows into a beautiful, but unusual young woman who is shunned and often feared by the other villagers. The only person who seems to understand her is a handsome young man she has been secretly meeting on the beach since childhood, James.The two begin to wonder if they may have something more than friendship between them, but their different social stations seem to stand in their way. Pearl and James' love seems doomed, until a mysterious stranger appears and changes everything.A very romantic and unique fairytale retelling. One of the best in the series.

Michener\n- **Publish Year:** 2015\n- **Description:** \"Massive, beautiful . . . unquestionably some of the best writing on Spain [and] the best that Mr. Michener has ever done on any subject.\"\u2014The Wall Street Journal Spain is an immemorial land like no other, one that James A. Michener, the Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning author and celebrated citizen of the world, came to love as his own. Iberia is Michener's enduring nonfiction tribute to his cherished second home. In the fresh and vivid prose that is his trademark, he not only reveals the celebrated history of bullfighters and warrior kings, painters and processions, cathedrals and olive orchards, he also shares the intimate, often hidden country he came to know, where the congeniality of living souls is thrust against the dark weight of history. Wild, contradictory, passionately beautiful, this is Spain as experienced by a master writer.\n- **Top Review:** This is not like most Michener books, which are generally fictional; this is his personal travelogue of his impressions of many travels all over Spain. It should be understood that it was published in the late 1960s and that much has since changed in Spain since that time. While 'Iberia' is normally taken (in the USA, at least) to incorporate Portugal, Michener is writing almost exclusively about Spain in this book.Michener clearly loved Spain and knew many Spaniards as friends. He discusses Spain's history, culture, art, literature, dance, geography, sports, and spirituality. Rather than putting all that into nice neat little buckets, he weaves it all together to paint an entrancing picture of the Spanish soul as he knows it.Unlike many such authors, Michener uses photos very carefully to illustrate aspects of Spanish culture, from the assuredly adamant eyes of the Guardia Civil to the warm smiles of the poorest people. He also takes a lot of time to explain words that are difficult to translate and what they tell us about Spanish culture.Recommended with equal enthusiasm whether from the viewpoint of history, religion, culture, or art. Also of special value to those living in Spanish-speaking countries or regions with large Hispanic populations, as Spain's influence on those cultures, as a mother country, is readily apparent.Bravo, Sr. Michener.

NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER Yuval Noah Harari, author of the critically-acclaimed New York Times bestseller and international phenomenon Sapiens, returns with an equally original, compelling, and provocative book, turning his focus toward humanity's future, and our quest to upgrade humans into gods. Over the past century humankind has managed to do the impossible and rein in famine, plague, and war. This may seem hard to accept, but, as Harari explains in his trademark style\u2014thorough, yet riveting\u2014famine, plague and war have been transformed from incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces of nature into manageable challenges. For the first time ever, more people die from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals put together. The average American is a thousand times more likely to die from binging at McDonalds than from being blown up by Al Qaeda. What then will replace famine, plague, and war at the top of the human agenda? As the self-made gods of planet earth, what destinies will we set ourselves, and which quests will we undertake? Homo Deus explores the projects, dreams and nightmares that will shape the twenty-first century\u2014from overcoming death to creating artificial life. It asks the fundamental questions: Where do we go from here? And how will we protect this fragile world from our own destructive powers? This is the next stage of evolution. This is Homo Deus. With the same insight and clarity that made Sapiens an international hit and a New York Times bestseller, Harari maps out our future.\n- Death in the Air (Rated 4): Op zesendertigjarige leeftijd wordt de briljante en ambitieuze neurochirurg Paul Kalanithi gediagnosticeerd met stadium IV longkanker. Van de ene op de andere dag verandert hij van een arts die levens redt in een pati\u00ebnt die moet vechten voor zijn eigen leven. De laatste 22 maanden van zijn leven besluit hij zijn grote ambitie waar te maken: een meesterlijk boek schrijven over zijn bijzondere levensloop. Wat maakt het leven nog de moeite waard als je de dood in de ogen kijkt? Wat doe je als al je dromen over een toekomst plaats moeten maken voor een miserabel noodlot? Wat betekent het om een kind te krijgen en nieuw leven op aarde te zetten terwijl je eigen leven langzaam wegebt? Paul Kalanithi stierf in maart 2015, terwijl hij de laatste hand legde aan zijn memoires. Zijn wijze observaties en rijke inzichten in het leven zijn hartverscheurend. Als adem vervliegt is een onvergetelijk boek over een naderend einde en de relatie tussen arts en pati\u00ebnt van een begenadigd schrijver, die helaas beide rollen moest vervullen.\n- **Disliked Books:**\nNone\n- **User's Additional Preferences:** I love books that make me think about the world and our place in history. Personal stories and life-changing events really resonate with me, especially if they deal with overcoming adversity.\n\n### Recommended Book: The Origin of Species\n- **Cosine Similarity:** 0.68\n- **Genre:** Science / General\n- **Author:** Charles Darwin\n- **Publish Year:** 2008\n- **Description:** On the Origin of Species, published on 24 November 1859, is a work of scientific literature by Charles Darwin which is considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. Darwin's book introduced the scientific theory that populations evolve over the course of generations through a process of natural selection.\n- **Top Review:** There is only one other book that is so widely known, discussed, and debated, yet so rarely read: that other book is the Bible. To make my point, here is a little quiz:1) Which name is most closely associated with the theory of evolution?2) Which book did this person write on evolution?3) What claims are made in that book?4) What else is contained in that book?With astonishing regularity, the average literate adult will respond as follows: 1) Darwin, 2) Origin of Species, 3) Humans descended from apes, and 4) I have no idea. The first two are correct, the third is absolutely false, and the fourth is an admission of complete ignorance. Considering that &quot;Origin of Species&quot; is over 600 pages long, and took nearly two decades to write, one would expect it to contain something more than the four simple words &quot;Humans descended from apes,&quot; which, in fact, it neither contains nor implies. So, what DOES it contain? There is one word that best summarizes the bulk of Darwin's magnum opus: &quot;observation&quot;.It is a lengthy book; at times it is tedious, at times politically incorrect, and at times scientifically off-base. But, despite its numerous flaws, it is one of the greatest achievements in the history of mankind. Even if you are among the few who refuse to accept Darwin's ideas, you cannot deny their impact. The theory is the cornerstone--if not the very foundation--of modern biology. Whatever your preconceptions, you will likely be surprised by this work. Darwin was the consummate naturalist and scientist, as well as a refined and articulate gentleman. &quot;Origin&quot; is a delight and an epiphany to read. It's amazing how much Darwin got right, despite the fact that he had essentially no idea of how inheritance worked. It's amazing how much data Darwin carefully assembled, analyzed, and described. It's amazing how meticulously Darwin weighed the evidence, noting when competing theories made different predictions, when the available evidence was not what he would have expected, and what future evidence could completely discredit (falsify) his theory. It's amazing in its honesty.The misconceptions about &quot;Origin of Species&quot; are not merely rampant, they are effectively universal, fueled (largely in the US) by the rise of creationism, which seeks first and foremost to vilify the theory of evolution as well as Darwin (often failing to distinguish between the two). It's worth the time to read this enormous but meticulously crafted volume, if only to allow you to form your own opinions about such an influential book. Once you have, take the little quiz again. You may need 600 pages to answer the last question.

But what happens when a rogue robot's idea of what is good for society contravenes the Three Laws?\n- **Top Review:** Isaac Asimov, the grand master of modern science fiction, wrote this classic collection of stories as the first in his Robot novel series. It deals with the relationships between human and robot. As one of Asimov's earliest novels, it introduced the Three Laws of Robotics that have set the standard for the use of robots in science fiction. In fact, Asimov was the acknowledged creator of the term &quot;robotics.&quot;The stories are tied together via the reminiscences of Dr. Susan Calvin, a robopsychologist for U. S. Robot and Mechanical Men, the corporation that invented and manufactured intelligent robots and computing machines. She reflects upon the evolution of these robots and discusses how little humanity really understands about the artificial intelligence it has created. Each story illuminates a problem encountered when a robot interprets the three fundamental Laws and something goes awry. One robot questions the reason for his existence. Another feels a necessity to lie. Yet another has an ego problem. The later stories introduce the reader to the Machines, powerful computing robots without the typical humanoid personalities of the working robots, that control the economic and industrial processes of the world and that stand between mankind and destruction. These stories introduce some fascinating and sometimes unsettling ideas: where does one draw the fine line between intelligent robot and human? Can man and robot form a balanced relationship? Can a robot's creator reliably predict its behavior based upon its programming? Can logic alone be used to determine what is best for humanity?&quot;I, Robot&quot; was published in 1950 and includes stories written in the 1940's, when general-purpose electronic digital computers were still in their infancy. I was struck by what a visionary Asimov was. He had captured the mechanics of contemporary software development through these stories about the manufacture of the intelligent robot, whose positronic brain contained complex programming that inevitably had bugs that needed troubleshooting. Anyone who has ever written a computer program or has fallen victim to software bugs will get an eerie feeling of deja vu while reading these stories. Asimov's writing style might not be the most polished in science fiction and his characterizations might be a bit wooden, but the concepts presented here will blow you away. This is required reading for any fan of science fiction.Eileen Rieback (Score: 5, Helpful: 103)\n\n### Task: Provide a Direct Explanation\nNow explain concisely why this book was recommended based on the user's data provided.\nMention both liked and disliked aspects if relevant.

Salinger\n- **Disliked Authors:** None\n- **Liked Books:**\n- THE CATCHER IN THE RYE (Rated 5): Anyone who has read J. D. Salinger's New Yorker stories - particularly A Perfect Day for Bananafish, Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut, The Laughing Man, and For Esme - With Love and Squalor, will not be surprised by the fact that his first novel is full of children. The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep.\n- To Kill a Mockingbird (Rated 5): Harper Lee's classic novel of a lawyer in the Deep South defending a black man charged with the rape of a white girl. One of the best-loved stories of all time, To Kill a Mockingbird has earned many distinctions since its original publication in 1960. It won the Pulitzer Prize, has been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than thirty million copies worldwide, and been made into an enormously popular movie. Most recently, librarians across the country gave the book the highest of honors by voting it the best novel of the twentieth century.\n- **Disliked Books:**\nNone\n- **User's Additional Preferences:** I enjoy books that explore human nature and the complexities of society. I gravitate toward classic literature that deals with important moral questions and personal growth.\n\n### Recommended Book: The grapes of wrath\n- **Cosine Similarity:** 0.88\n- **Genre:** Fiction / Literary\n- **Author:** John Steinbeck\n- **Publish Year:** 1993\n- **Description:** 1940 Pulitzer Prize winner. Moving story of a family, moved out of the Oklohoma dust bowl region by economic desperation, who head for California as migrant fruit pickers - finally defeated but still resolute.\n- **Top Review:** I have never read a better novel written by an American than THE GRAPES OF WRATH. Steinbeck's deeply touching tale of displaced families and a nation rent by Depression will never cease to be relevant.The Joads and thousands of others are driven out of Oklahoma by drought and the Depression. It is bad enough they lose their farms to homes and have to move. It is worse that the big business fruit growers in California print misleading flyers claiming to have far more well-paying jobs available than they ever intended to have. It is miserable when they get to California (where the people curse them as \"Okies\") and find out that as few as one man owns as much a million acres--much of it lying fallow in front of their eyes.As difficult as the plight of the Joads and families like them, Steinbeck does not paint the Californians or their police as evil so much as scared into treachery and violence in order to protect their own. No one wants to starve and starvation after the dust bowl and thanks to the exploitative wages paid by the vineyard owners is a very real possibility. Nor does he canonize the migrants--the societies that grow up by the side of the road each night have their own laws and lawbreakers, stout hearts and slatterns--but does show them as civilized people who don't deserve being treated like animals. Many fearful Californians don't agree.Steinbeck's character Tom Joad (whose ghost lives on in a Bruce Springsteen's song recently covered by Rage Against the Machine) is as important to American literature as Huckleberry Finn, Holden Caulfield and Jay Gatsby. Joad knows life offers no simple solutions, but he also knows that fair is fair. When a man's employers charge him for his work gear AND operate the stores where he must buy his food so that he often ends up OWING his employers more at the end of the week than his pitiful wages can cover, Tom Joad knows that's not just. He knows the land is fertile enough to feed everyone, so don't try giving him any speeches about \"private property\" and \"supply and demand.\" If the test of a system and a society is how it treats it poorest members (especially in a crisis like the Depression), then the world the Joads live in fails miserably.No less strong a character than her son Tom, Ma Joad embodies all the cliches about being a tower of strength without actually being a clich&eacute; herself. She and her family possess all the true grit and hearty spirit America prides itself on as a nation of pioneers, but by the 1930s the frontier has been bought up and the pioneers are in desperate straits.This book is occasionally criticized for being too socialistic. This criticism is misguided; what THE GRAPES OF WRATH does is show how capitalism can and often does enrich the few while the many suffer. Steinbeck shows how breadbasket farmers were thrown off the land they had worked for generations so bankers in the East can make more profit. Can this happen today, even in a time of tremendous prosperity? Ask today's family farmers what agribusiness has done to them. THE GRAPES OF WRATH is no call to play the \"Internationale,\" but it does starkly and intelligently raise questions about the meaning of equal opportunity and justice for all.This is a book that should be required reading for Alan Greenspan, the editors of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL, and triumphal capitalists everywhere who wince for their stock dividends when the unemployment rate goes down. Not to mention every single elected official in the United States. The subject matter is extremely heavy and sad, but Steinbeck's style is straightforward and easy (even with the various dialects he employs perfectly). THE GRAPES OF WRATH does what so very few great novels can: it will take a lot out of you, but leave you with much more than you had when you began.

Goodreads Choice Award for the best young adult novel of the year! In this sequel to the acclaimed Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda\u2014now a major motion picture, Love, Simon\u2014we follow Simon's BFF Leah as she grapples with changing friendships, first love, and senior year angst. When it comes to drumming, Leah Burke is usually on beat\u2014but real life isn't always so rhythmic. She's an anomaly in her friend group: the only child of a young, single mom, and her life is decidedly less privileged. She loves to draw but is too self-conscious to show it. And even though her mom knows she's bisexual, she hasn't mustered the courage to tell her friends\u2014not even her openly gay BFF, Simon. So Leah really doesn't know what to do when her rock-solid friend group starts to fracture in unexpected ways. With prom and college on the horizon, tensions are running high. It's hard for Leah to strike the right note while the people she loves are fighting\u2014especially when she realizes she might love one of them more than she ever intended. Plus don't miss Yes No Maybe So, Becky Albertalli's and Aisha Saeed's heartwarming and hilarious new novel, coming in 2020!\n- **Top Review:** This subtle and penetrating novel tells the tale of Leah, a single woman in New York City in the late 1950s or early 1960s. Caught between her self-involved father and her mother, whom she has learned to disdain, Leah has to find herself outside her relations to her parents in order to finally become an adult. This doesn't sound like much fun, but the writing is so evocative and all the characters, even minor ones, are so real and so memorable that it is like looking into somebody else's life.I especially enjoyed the almost tactile sense of a New York City that is as past and gone is Edith Wharton's. This was an era when someone like Ed Bernstein, a fantastic scheming minor character, could find his family a rent-controlled apartment just by reading the newspaper. The characters are all basically Jewish working-class people whose sense of being New Yorkers is so profound that it is never expressed. This was a different city, perhaps less entertaining but definitely more accessible for the non-rich.It is surprising that the book didn't make more of a splash.

Since she was a somewhat mysterious figure, while President Kennedy was still viewed as Prince Charming and the myth of Camelot still persisted, she was cast by the liberal media as the villain of the piece, a prostitute, a party girl, etc. and felt the need to tell her side of the story; thus this book.The book is essentially Judy's life story as told from a woman's perspective but seems to have been aimed at presenting JFK, Sam Giancana, and Judy, herself, in the best possible light. Disappointingly, it sheds no light on the criminal aspects of Kennedy's activities in promoting the assassination attempt and fails to address her activities in that regard in any meaningful way. As a consequence, although the book is extremely interesting from a prurient viewpoint, it tells little about what really went on between Kennedy and Sam Giancana's criminal outfit.It should be kept in mind, however, that when this book was written most of the principals involved in the plot, President Kennedy, Robert Kennedy, John Roselli, and Sam Giancana had already been murdered (Giancana shortly before he was to testify); and Judy, as she said much later in life, was afraid to tell the whole story. So, although this book makes truly fascinating reading -- especially if you want to really see how the rich, famous, powerful, and ruthless live -- time and more recent revelations have passed it by.For the complete story, I suggest you read \"Joseph P. Kennedy: The Mogul, the Mob, the Statesman, and the Making of an American Myth\" by Ted Schwarz and \"The Dark Side of Camelot\" by Seymour M. Hersh, but by all means read this one too. You'll really be amazed at how the other half lives.

Inspired by visions he has experienced for many years, it appears to be a book written far into the future: a history of humanity from the date of his death up to 2105. The Shape of Things to Come provides this 'history of the future', an account that was in some ways remarkably prescient - predicting climatic disaster and sweeping cultural changes, including a Second World War, the rise of chemical warfare, and political instabilities in the Middle East.\n- Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Rated 4): Referring to \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, \" H. L. Mencken noted that his discovery of this classic American novel was \"the most stupendous event of my whole life\"; Ernest Hemingway declared that \"all modern American literature stems from this one book,\" while T. S. Eliot called Huck \"one of the permanent symbolic figures of fiction, not unworthy to take a place with Ulysses, Faust, Don Quixote, Don Juan, Hamlet.\" The novel's preeminence derives from its wonderfully imaginative re-creation of boyhood adventures along the mighty Mississippi River, its inspired characterization, the author's remarkable ear for dialogue, and the book's understated development of serious underlying themes: \"natural\" man versus \"civilized\" society, the evils of slavery, the innate value and dignity of human beings, the stultifying effects of convention, and other topics. But most of all, \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\" is a wonderful story filled with high adventure and unforgettable characters (including the great river itself) that no one who has read it will ever forget.

But any one can read Tom Sawyer and really love it. It has many MANY a funny part. Tom has many fun times with his friends and their imaginations have no limit. The reader gets to learn about boys and girls(mostly boys) that lived more than a hundred years ago. What really appealed to me was the fact that the lives and minds of children then are not too different from children today. Kids today are obsessed with television. Kids back then were obsessed with books and too commonly took make believe for reality. They played tricks on one another and commonly bugged adults or the opposite gender. Often times, they were very superstitous and strongly believed in ghosts and magic. The reader is also swept away by the many adventures of Tom and his friends. Many of their adventures are a part of imagination, pretending to be pirates or Robin Hood. But Tom and Huck do get to have a few real adventures, specifically with the murderer, caves, and river island. The story doesn't have much of a plot or significance, but that is the way it was meant to be, for the story is funny and tickles the reader. It satires and plays with life. I highly recommend it to everyone, for it is important to know the relationship between our time and the past, boys and girls, youth and adults, the mature and immature, and every opposite. Enjoy!

Provoking, stimulating, shocking and dazzling' Observer **One of the BBC's 100 Novels That Shaped Our World**\n- **Top Review:** As critic and best-selling author Neil Postman points out so well in the introduction to his book &quot;Amusing Ourselves To Death&quot;, we have congratulated ourselves prematurely by figuring we made it past the totalitarian nightmare state depicted in George Orwell's gripping cautionary tale &quot;1984&quot;. Perhaps, Postman suggest, we should remember another visionary totalitarian nightmare scenario and use it to critically examine the contemporary state of social and psychological well-being. Of course he was referring to Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World, written before Orwell's by 15 or so years, and even more frightening in its own way in the world it describes. More and more, that frightening vision looks like our contemporary world.Picture his ironic portrait of a populace doped into Nirvana on &quot;soma&quot; (read Prozac and Zoloft), isolated and diverted by petty preoccupations in mindless trivial pursuits (read video games and internet surfing to all the porno sites), oblivious to anything not directly pertaining to themselves and totally unaware of the degree to which they are being socially, economically, and politically co-opted. Beginning to sound more familiar? Remember, says Huxley, brute force is not the only method an oligarchy can use to influence, manage, and finally control our hard-won freedoms and liberties; it can be done with over-indulgence and the deliberate fertilization and promulgation of apathy through self-absorption, as well.Even Huxley says (circa 1960, almost 30 years after the original publication) in the preface of the revised version of the book that he is alarmed as to how quickly the sort of events he figured might take a hundred years such as the appearance of political internationalism and transnational corporate entities are already arising and beginning to control more and more of the substance of our social, economic, and political lives. Just how much do we know other than what we hear and see on television, for example? Yet the electronic media is owned and managed by transnational corporations. Ever wonder why we never heard much muckraking news coverage of the NAFTA or GATT deals even though many recogized the two bills would radically change the nature of international trade? Perhaps the transnationals didn't want too much hype or fuss. Starting to feel uncomfortable yet? Still, people keep insisting this was just a whimsical work of fiction, that it was a parable, that he really wasn't serious.Want to find out more? Read this book, but do so slowly, taking notes, recognizing how many contemporary parallels there are to each of the &quot;whimsical details&quot; he conjures up, and then figure out in your own mind how very close he was to prognosticating just how far we have come toward the &quot;Brave New World&quot; in which everyone's soul and awareness is for sale. The kids are wowed by the recent movie The Matrix\", yet few appreciate just how much of a fabled existence we are already living in. No pain, no sorrow, no trouble of any kind. Instead, we have our individual and collective consciousness &quot;managed&quot; pharmaceutically; our psyches eased into blithering bliss with &quot;soma&quot;, our diminishing attention spans sidetracked and occupied by petty diversions and endless entertainments. Pass me the corndogs, honey!But, hey! Don't touch that dial; Regis is on! They may retry OJ! What did Bill Clinton really do with that cigar? Have you seen the latest news about the stock market? Did you get any of that new beer they're advertising? it's supposed to make me a real ladies man....What's the latest gadget? Can I buy one on-line? By the way, where are the kids? Hell, never mind, just turn up the volume; I think I know the answer to that question Regis just asked... Meanwhile, folks, our awareness of what is going on around us, our rights and our liberties are being power-washed away, obliterated, and we cannot even see it happening in front of us. We are diverted, distracted, content in our own little worlds. So welcome to our nightmare. Better beware; it just looks like Nirvana. It's really another &quot;Brave New World&quot;.

His retelling tracks all of the major and minor characters\u2014JFK, Lee Harvey Oswald, Jack Ruby, Jackie, and more\u2014illuminating a human drama that many readers believe they know well.\n- **Top Review:** John F Kennedy, the 35th. American President, served from January 20, 1961 until he was assassinated in Dallas-Texas on November 22, 1963.During his short term in office important events took place and some of their effects, after forty-four years, are still living with us up to this day.For instance, Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, Cuban Missile Crises and his confrontation with Nikita Khrushchev - American U2 Spy Plane.The establishment of the Berlin Wall and USA subsequent estrangement with USSR.The Space Race with the Soviets and his solemn promise to America to outpace USSR by pushing research and development of the Space Program.The beginning of Vietnam crises.The energetic inauguration of American Civil rights.The book referred to all the above, but did not touch base with something equally important.Israel.The Negev Nuclear Research Centre located about ten kilometres to the south Dimona in Israel.It has never been a secret that in 1958, the French helped Israel construct the centre.{{{The year 1958 was filled with open unrest in the Middle East. a) Union between Egypt and Syria. b) Civil disturbances in the Lebanon c) Coup in Iraq - suspected as communists. d) The Marines landed in Lebanon, and e) The height of the Algerian Revolution and its adverse impact on the Franco-Egyptian relations}}}.Nevertheless, officially the centre was built as nuclear reactor to help produce additional power for `desalination plant' to water the Negev desert.The world concluded that the purpose of Dimona was not as announced. Israel constructed it to build nuclear weapons. The Arab world, estranged with Israel since day one, suspected the Israelis were applying a policy shrouded in ambiguity and equivocation.Dimona began active work in the beginning of 1962 and was able to produce plutonium. Arab university professors gathered in Cairo and their forum reached the conclusion that enriched uranium was also produced.USA intelligence was able to assess the purpose of Dimona since the beginning of 1960 and insisted that Israel should agree to comply with international standards of `inspection' (Israel never signed the Nuclear non-Proliferation Pact that began late in 1960).Indeed, Ben Gurion agreed to international inspection provided 1) Inspectors are USA citizens or under the sole supervision of the USA, and 2) that Israel would receive advance notice of the schedule of inspection.Some suspected that since Israel was able to receive advance warning of the date of inspection, it was a lot easy to makeover, hide, evade, and cover, ahead of time, sensitive data at the site away from the scrutinizing eyes of the inspectors.The inspectors informed USA administration of their qualms and complained that their work, in the absence of professional surprise check, would be rendered futile, useless and a waste of time. The inspectors didn't agree to any restrictions put to them by the Israelis concerning the `areas' or `the facilities' they intended to check.Ben Gurion was adamant \"there will be no surprise visits\", and Kennedy was determined to `go by the book', `the inspectors should apply the guidelines to the letter and produce their appraisal, independently, as in any other place in the world. Exempting Israel would be taken as precedent'.As expected, the charismatic young American president won over the old man of Israel. Dimona was put under the Inspectors Microscope.But for how long??When Lyndon B Johnson succeeded the assassinated President he did not pursue the same stringent approach as his predecessor.Dimona was completed to the best of Israel's abilities...............

In it, Nietzsche presents a set of problems, criticisms and philosophical challenges that continue both to inspire and to trouble contemporary thought. In addition, he offers his most subtle, detailed and sophisticated account of the virtues, ideas, and practices which will characterize philosophy and philosophers of the future. With his relentlessly energetic style and tirelessly probing manner, Nietzsche embodies the type of thought he wants to foster, while defining its historical role and determining its agenda. This edition offers a new and readable translation, by Judith Norman, of one of the most influential texts in the history of philosophy, together with an introduction by Rolf-Peter Horstmann that sets it in its historical and philosophical context.\n- Immanuel Kant's Critique of pure reason (Rated 4): The masterpiece of the father of modern philosophy A seminal text of modern philosophy, Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (1781) made history by bringing together two opposing schools of thought: rationalism, which grounds all our knowledge in reason, and empiricism, which traces all our knowledge to experience. Published here in a lucid reworking of Max M\u00fcller's classic translation, the Critique is a profound investigation into the nature of human reason, establishing its truth, falsities, illusions, and reality. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.\n- Commodore (Highbridge Distribution) (Rated 4): Timeless wisdom on controlling anger in personal life and politics from the Roman Stoic philosopher and statesman Seneca In his essay \"On Anger\" (De Ira), the Roman Stoic thinker Seneca (c. 4 BC\u201365 AD) argues that anger is the most destructive passion: \"No plague has cost the human race more dear.\" This was proved by his own life, which he barely preserved under one wrathful emperor, Caligula, and lost under a second, Nero. This splendid new translation of essential selections from \"On Anger,\" presented with an enlightening introduction and the original Latin on facing pages, offers readers a timeless guide to avoiding and managing anger. It vividly illustrates why the emotion is so dangerous and why controlling it would bring vast benefits to individuals and society. Drawing on his great arsenal of rhetoric, including historical examples (especially from Caligula's horrific reign), anecdotes, quips, and soaring flights of eloquence, Seneca builds his case against anger with mounting intensity. Like a fire-and-brimstone preacher, he paints a grim picture of the moral perils to which anger exposes us, tracing nearly all the world's evils to this one toxic source. But he then uplifts us with a beatific vision of the alternate path, a path of forgiveness and compassion that resonates with Christian and Buddhist ethics. Seneca's thoughts on anger have never been more relevant than today, when uncivil discourse has increasingly infected public debate. Whether seeking personal growth or political renewal, readers will find, in Seneca's wisdom, a valuable antidote to the ills of an angry age.\n- **Disliked Books:**\nNone\n- **User's Additional Preferences:** I prefer dense philosophical works that challenge conventional thinking. I'm interested in works that explore ethics, metaphysics, and the nature of knowledge. Avoid overly religious or speculative sci-fi themes.\n\n### Recommended Book: The Republic (Penguin Classics)\n- **Cosine Similarity:** 0.87\n- **Genre:** Philosophy / General\n- **Author:** Plato\n- **Publish Year:** 2007\n- **Description:** Plato's Republic is widely acknowledged as the cornerstone of Western philosophy. Presented in the form of a dialogue between Socrates and three different interlocutors, it is an enquiry into the notion of a perfect community and the ideal individual within it. During the conversation other questions are raised: what is goodness; what is reality; what is knowledge? The Republic also addresses the purpose of education and the role of both women and men as 'guardians' of the people. With remarkable lucidity and deft use of allegory, Plato arrives at a depiction of a state bound by harmony and ruled by 'philosopher kings'.\n- **Top Review:** It has been said that all philosophic work of the past 2400 years stands as footnotes to Plato's writings. 'Do the ends justify the means? What is justice? Whom does it serve? Who should serve as its guardians? Is it absolute or relative?'Plato's protagonist is his old teacher, Socrates. The arguments are presented as dialogues and thus embody a literary aspect different from many, although certainly not all, subsequent philosophical writings. His object is \"no trivial question, but the manner in which a man ought to live.\" The answers are seen to point to the manner in which a utopian society should be operated.As a storied mountain calls to a climber from afar, Plato calls to the student of the art of thinking. This is why we read Plato, for the \"neo-Platonists\" -- Plotinus, Augustine, Descartes, Leibniz, Kant, Whitehead, G&ouml;del, and others -- have certainly propounded improved philosophy. But it is Plato on whom they improve. Most thinkers (perhaps especially most mathematicians and logicians) yet agree with Plato, at least insofar as his understanding of \"form\" -- often adapted or restated as: ideas / perfection / consciousness / mind / or, 'the thing in itself'.Plato's realm of [what he calls] \"forms\" acknowledges the mysterious, yet logically necessary, existence of non-material reality. In Republic he views this as the realm of reference in constructing his understanding of an ideal society. We find in the work of subsequent thinkers (and within Plato's Republic as well) that this non-material reality is perhaps more easily recognized in purer considerations of reason, aesthetics, mathematics, music, love, spiritual experience, and ultimately in consciousness itself, than in idealized human social institutions. Mathematics, for example, although readily practiced in material ways, is not itself material. Thus the understanding of the purity of reason as opposed to the synthetic (and uncertain) nature of empiricism, arises from the work of Plato (and is particularly well developed in Descartes' existentialism).Modern readers should rightly find that Plato regards the State too highly; in pursuit of an ideal State his supposedly improved citizen is highly restricted and censored. His \"utopian\" citizens are automatons, bred by the State; unsanctioned infants are \"disposed of.\" Where his ideas are wrongly developed, they are in fact important ideas, i.e., they are issues deserving serious examination. Should the ruling class be restricted to philosophers? Plato says yes, that wisdom and intellectual insight are more desirable in leaders than are either birthright or popularity. Of course we, in the democratic West, tend to see this idea as totalitarianism, but it remains an interesting argument.Although the product of polytheistic culture, Plato is leery of the tangled accounts of the gods received from the poets, Homer, Hesiod, etc. His view of the divine -- that \"the chief good\" has one eternal, unchanging and surpassingly superior form -- which he also calls \"Providence\", hints strongly of the common ground which was to emerge between neo-Platonism and monotheism. Like Plato's proverbial cave dwellers, we perceive this transcendent entity through poorly understood \"shadows\" of the actual truth. Beside its philosophical, literary, political, and theological aspects, Republic is also important as a treatise on psychology, in fact the science of mind seems to have progressed very little beyond Plato's insights. Books 5-7 are particularly fascinating.

James Achilles Kirkpatrick was the British Resident at the court of the Nizam of Hyderabad when in 1798 he glimpsed Kahir un-Nissa\u2014'Most excellent among Women'\u2014the great-niece of the Nizam's Prime Minister and a descendant of the Prophet. Kirkpatrick had gone out to India as an ambitious soldier in the army of the East India Company, eager to make his name in the conquest and subjection of the subcontinent. Instead, he fell in love with Khair and overcame many obstacles to marry her\u2014not least of which was the fact that she was locked away in purdah and engaged to a local nobleman. Eventually, while remaining Resident, Kirkpatrick converted to Islam, and according to Indian sources even became a double-agent working for the Hyderabadis against the East India Company. It is a remarkable story, involving secret assignations, court intrigue, harem politics, religious and family disputes. But such things were not unknown; from the early sixteenth century, when the Inquisition banned the Portuguese in Goa from wearing the dhoti, to the eve of the Indian mutiny, the 'white Mughals' who wore local dress and adopted Indian ways were a source of embarrassments to successive colonial administrations. William Dalrymple unearths such colourful figures as 'Hindoo Stuart', who travelled with his own team of Brahmins to maintain his temple of idols, and who spent many years trying to persuade the memsahibs of Calcutta to adopt the sari; and Sir David Ochterlony, Kirkpatrick's counterpart in Delhi, who took all thirteen of his wives out for evening promenades, each on the back of their own elephant. In White Mughals, William Dalrymple discovers a world almost entirely unexplored by history, and places at its centre a compelling tale of love, seduction and betrayal. It possesses all the sweep and resonance of a great nineteenth-century novel, set against a background of shifting alliances and the manoeuvring of the great powers, the mercantile ambitions of the British and the imperial dreams of Napoleon. White Mughals, the product of five years' writing and research, triumphantly confirms Dalrymple's reputation as one of the finest writers at work today.\n- **User's Additional Preferences:** I enjoy classic tales with a mix of satire, adventure, and mythological elements.

So, for that matter, are wolves and racoons. A man, once named Jimmy, lives in a tree, wrapped in old bedsheets, now calls himself Snowman. The voice of Oryx, the woman he loved, teasingly haunts him. And the green-eyed Children of Crake are, for some reason, his responsibility. * Praise for Oryx and Crake: 'In Jimmy, Atwood has created a great character: a tragic-comic artist of the future, part buffoon, part Orpheus. An adman who's a sad man; a jealous lover who's in perpetual mourning; a fantasist who can only remember the past' -INDEPENDENT 'Gripping and remarkably imagined' -LONDON REVIEW OF BOOKS\n- **Top Review:** ORYX AND CRAKE by Margaret AtwoodShortlisted for the Booker Prize in 2003, ORYX AND CRAKE is Margaret Atwood's most apocalyptic story to date. For those of you who have read THE HANDMAID'S TALE, ORYX AND CRAKE is a lot more grim and depressing, in terms of the plight of the human race. It may be a challenge for some to get through this book. Those who are fans of Science Fiction and Speculative Fiction, however, may embrace this novel as I did. It is probably one of the best novels written by Margaret Atwood.There are two main themes in ORYX AND CRAKE. First, the novel takes place in the distant future, where global warming has changed the earth so much that the coastal cities no longer exist, and New York is now New New York. Going outside in the sun is a death sentence, so the wealthier areas of the world are protected under places known as compounds, although areas known as The Pleebands still exist, where people live and are still exposed to nature in all its glory.The second major plot line has to do with three central characters. Snowman is the narrator, also known as Jimmy, who at the start of the book is the only known surviving human being on the face of the planet. The book starts off with Snowman sleeping in a tree, barely alive, knowing that he does not have too much longer to live. Food is scarce, the sun is so hot he has blisters all over his body, and the genetically engineered creatures the wolvogs and the pigoons that have escaped are now roaming the grounds.While he tries to keep alive, Snowman also keeps watch over a group of humanoid creatures called the Crakers, named after his \"best\" friend Crake, who was somehow responsible over the creation of these people. These Crakers are supposedly the ideal humans. They have no emotional desires, in particular no sex drives, except to pro-create. There is no reason for war, with this new type of human being. They are vegetarians, and do not desire meat. They are very simple people, and Snowman had promised to care for them if anything happened to Crake.As Snowman goes back in time to reflect on the past, we learn more about Crake, who was an egotistical brilliant young man who had visions of a so-called better world. The third main character is Oryx, a woman whose history takes the reader to a third world Asian country where she was sold into a type of servitude, and eventually becomes a prostitute. She then finds her way to the western world and ends up working with Crake, becoming part of his plan when he creates the Crakers. Their story is revealed in pieces, told while Snowman goes on an adventure to find food and seek out the compound where it had all began. Snowman wants to go back to this place, hoping to find answers and food and supplies, and to remember the reasons why the human race was nearly obliterated. It's the story of these three and their lopsided relationship that leads us to answers of why the world \"ended\".The new concepts and horrors that are being introduced in the book may overwhelm the reader. However, the most important theme to focus on is \"what really happened\"? Why is Snowman the only person left on the planet? What happened to Oryx and Crake? This is what drove me to finish this book. I could not put it down. The reader is left in the dark until the very end, when it is finally revealed how the human race was nearly wiped out. It is a very futuristic and depressing story of how mankind can go wrong in the search of a better world.I have always had a fascination with books that take on a type of apocalyptic theme. Margaret Atwood's vision of the earth's future is not a pretty sight, but it was her story of Oryx, Crake and Snowman that made the book worthwhile. I am giving this book 5 stars, and it will most likely be in my top 5 for 2003.

Some have blamed their lecturers, and some have blamed their textbooks. But I am not swayed!Thus, despite all the negative rantings some reviewers have labelled against this \"Advanced Engineering Mathematics\", I will advise you to see for yourself. This book is superb! Erwin Kreyszig should be honoured with a twenty-one gun salute, for compiling this outstanding compendium.The way this book dissected Numerical Methods, Differential Equation, and Vector Calculus, will rouse envy in many academic circles. The same applies to its unsurpassed analyses of Oscillation Matrices, Quantum Symmetries, and Linear Algebra. I wonder why all those condemnations! In fact, I will advise those complainants to go back to primary school.As its name depicts, this text is an advanced book, and not an introductory one. Still, its author took the necessary pains in tabling an uncomplicated presentation. I will, with great pleasure, recommend it to any Engineering or Science student who needs an advanced mathematics textbook.

Important Notice: Media content referenced within the product description or the product text may not be available in the ebook version.\n- **Top Review:** It is not unusual for those who failed to pass (or understand) their courses to look for cheap scapegoats. Some have blamed their lecturers, and some have blamed their textbooks. But I am not swayed!Thus, despite all the negative rantings some reviewers have labelled against this \"Advanced Engineering Mathematics\", I will advise you to see for yourself. This book is superb! Erwin Kreyszig should be honoured with a twenty-one gun salute, for compiling this outstanding compendium.The way this book dissected Numerical Methods, Differential Equation, and Vector Calculus, will rouse envy in many academic circles. The same applies to its unsurpassed analyses of Oscillation Matrices, Quantum Symmetries, and Linear Algebra. I wonder why all those condemnations! In fact, I will advise those complainants to go back to primary school.As its name depicts, this text is an advanced book, and not an introductory one. Still, its author took the necessary pains in tabling an uncomplicated presentation. I will, with great pleasure, recommend it to any Engineering or Science student who needs an advanced mathematics textbook.

Says the author\" \"This book... is not written for the members of fringe political groups, such as the Weatherman, or The Minutemen. Those radical groups don't need this book. They already know everything that's in here. If the real people of America, the silent majority, are going to survive, they must educate themselves. That is the purpose of this book.\" In what the author considers a survival guide, there is explicit information on the uses and effects of drugs, ranging from pot to heroin to peanuts. There i detailed advice concerning electronics, sabotage, and surveillance, with data on everything from bugs to scramblers. There is a comprehensive chapter on natural, non-lethal, and lethal weapons, running the gamut from cattle prods to sub-machine guns to bows and arrows.\n- **Top Review:** First published in the turbulent '60's, this book has attained a sort of cult status for that time. It reflects many of the mores and problems of that generation of young people, and is worth it for a read for that, if for no other reason.So far as bomb-making and all of that, the book is technically good, but the methodology involving use of nitrogen compounds, particularly red, fuming nitric acid and cotton, to make guncotton, is fundamentally ununsound and unsafe. You could blow a hand off or worse very easily, following Powell's directions. I think &quot;The Monkeywrench Gang&quot; and others of its genre are more in tune with today's eco-warrior desires. Also, the book never mentions the superiority of Oxydol and its green beads, as a binding agent for homemade napalm. For shame.Even with these quibbles, the book is entertaining, and offers a clear glimpse into the mentality of a now-settled generation.

She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells\u2014taken without her knowledge\u2014became one of the most important tools in medicine: The first \"immortal\" human cells grown in culture, which are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb's effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave. Henrietta's family did not learn of her \"immortality\" until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family\u2014past and present\u2014is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family\u2014especially Henrietta's daughter Deborah. Deborah was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Had they killed her to harvest her cells? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn't her children afford health insurance? Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.\n- Awakening (Rated 5): Awakenings--which inspired the major motion picture--is the remarkable story of a group of patients who contracted sleeping-sickness during the great epidemic just after World War I. Frozen for decades in a trance-like state, these men and women were given up as hopeless until 1969, when Dr. Oliver Sacks gave them the then-new drug L-DOPA, which had an astonishing, explosive, \"awakening\" effect. Dr. Sacks recounts the moving case histories of his patients, their lives, and the extraordinary transformations which went with their reintroduction to a changed world.\n- **Disliked Books:**\n- Eclipse (Rated 1): As the love triangle heats up in the third book, Bella must choose between her friendship with Jacob and her romance with Edward -- and her decision could change the fate of vampires and werewolves forever.

In the midst of it all, she is forced to choose between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob -- knowing that her decision has the potential to ignite the ageless struggle between vampire and werewolf. With her graduation quickly approaching, Bella has one more decision to make: life or death. But which is which?

Chapters are allocated to separate subjects such as reincarnation, search for the physical evidence of the human soul, spiritualism, physical mediums, etc. Unfortunately, Ms. Roach seems to be far more intertested in milking wisecracks out of her \"research\" than she is in doing any heavy lifting, and the breezy, smartacre style wears out its welcome quickly. You can certainly tell she comes to the subject with a tabula rasa: she obviously never heard of Harry Price, much less other lesser-known parapsychologists. It's an entertaining read, but I couldn't recommend it as anything approaching what I had expected it to be: a sceptic's investigation into the survival of human personality after death. Think of it more as \"Cosmo Travels the World in Search of Spooks, Giggles, and People With Funny Names\".

An ancient Chinese text on the philosophy and politics of warfare and military strategy, the treatise was written in 6th century B.C. by a warrior-philosopher now famous all over the world as Sun Tzu.

Rinse and repeat. Then Johnny's monotonous life takes a tumble. The laundromat where Arty works, and the one thing that gives him happiness, is about to be sold.

This splendid new translation of essential selections from \"On Anger,\" presented with an enlightening introduction and the original Latin on facing pages, offers readers a timeless guide to avoiding and managing anger. It vividly illustrates why the emotion is so dangerous and why controlling it would bring vast benefits to individuals and society. Drawing on his great arsenal of rhetoric, including historical examples (especially from Caligula's horrific reign), anecdotes, quips, and soaring flights of eloquence, Seneca builds his case against anger with mounting intensity. Like a fire-and-brimstone preacher, he paints a grim picture of the moral perils to which anger exposes us, tracing nearly all the world's evils to this one toxic source. But he then uplifts us with a beatific vision of the alternate path, a path of forgiveness and compassion that resonates with Christian and Buddhist ethics. Seneca's thoughts on anger have never been more relevant than today, when uncivil discourse has increasingly infected public debate. Whether seeking personal growth or political renewal, readers will find, in Seneca's wisdom, a valuable antidote to the ills of an angry age.\n- **Top Review:** Don't read this book unless you have read the previous sixteen in the series. It's not that this book is bad on its own but simply that you will miss so much by not having grown with Aubrey and Maturin as they make their way through the shoals and lee shores of war and peace, marriage and separation, famine and feast. These books have been compared with the Hornblower series but this damns them with faint praise. They are, in every respect, far superior, truly works of great literature. The research and the depth of character development are staggering achievements on their own but these are no stuffy historical tracts; the pages are filled with sly humour. There are great acts of courage and infamy and sweeping tragedy. There is the story, which threads its way through all the books, of a lasting, deep friendship between two disparate personalities. The scenes of battle, winning and losing are among the best writing of this century. Think I exaggerate? Buy the first three books in the series and see for yourself.

That optimism is not always the key to life's problems is elucidated. A tale of love amalgamated with suffering, sacrifice and pain. Captivating!\n- **Top Review:** Ever since philosophers began thinking about the meaning of life, a favorite question has been \"Why do bad things happen to good people?\". In Voltaire's day, this issue was primarily pursued either from the perspective of faith (everything that happens is God's will and must be for Divine purpose) or of reason (What do these events mean to you, as you interpret them subjectively?). Infuriated by the reaction by some members of the church to a horrible loss of life from an earthquake in Lisbon, Voltaire wrote this hard-biting satire of the human condition to explore these questions.Before reading further, let me share a word of caution. This book is filled with human atrocities of the most gruesome sort. Anything that you can imagine could occur in war, an Inquisition, or during piracy happens in this book. If you find such matters distressing (as many will, and more should), this book will be unpleasant reading. You should find another book to read.The book begins as Candide is raised in the household of a minor noble family in Westphalia, where he is educated by Dr. Pangloss, a student of metaphysical questions. Pangloss believes that this is the best of all possible worlds and deeply ingrains that view into his pupil. Candide is buoyed by that thought as he encounters many setbacks in the course of the book as he travels through many parts of Europe, Turkey, and South America.All is well for Candide until he falls in love with the Baron's daughter and is caught kissing her hand by the Baron. The Baron immediately kicks Candide out of the castle (literally on the backside), and Candide's wanderings begin. Think of this as being like expulsion from the Garden of Eden for Adam. Soon the penniless Candide finds himself in the Bulgarian army, and receiving lots of beatings while he learns to drill.The story grows more far-fetched with each subsequent incident. To the casual reader, this exaggeration can seem unnecessary and annoying. It will remind you of the most extreme parts of Swift in Gulliver's Travels and Rabelais in Gargantua and Pantagruel. But subtly, Voltaire is using the exaggeration to lure the reader into making complacent judgments about complacency itself that Voltaire wants to challenge. The result is a deliciously ironical work that undermines complacency at a more fundamental level than I have seen done elsewhere. Basically, Candide challenges any view you have about complacency that is defined in terms of the world-view of those who are complacent.Significant changes of circumstances (good and ill) occur to all of the members of the Baron's household over the course of the story. Throughout, there is much comparing of who has had the worst luck, with much feeling sorry for oneself.That is the surface story. Voltaire is, however, a master of misdirection. Beneath the surface, Voltaire has another purpose for the book. He also wants to expose the reader to questioning the many bad habits that people have that make matters worse for everyone. The major themes of these undercurrents are (1) competing rather than to cooperating, (2) employing inhumane means to accomplish worldly (and many spiritual) ends, (3) following expected rules of behavior to show one's superiority over others that harm and degrade others, (4) focusing on money and power rather than creating rich human relationships, (5) hypocritical behavior, and (6) pursuing ends that society approves of rather than ends that please oneself.By the end of the story, the focus shifts again to a totally different question: How can humans achieve happiness? Then, you have to reassess what you thought about the book and what was going on in Voltaire's story. Many readers will choose to reread the book to better capture Voltaire's perspective on that final question, having been surprised by it.Candide is one of my favorite books because it treats important philosophical questions in such an unusual way. Such unaccustomed matching of treatment and subject matters leaves an indelible impression that normal philosophical arguments can never match. Voltaire also has an amazing imagination. Few could concoct such a story (even by using illegal substances to stimulate the subconscious mind). I constantly find myself wondering what he will come up with next. The story is so absurd that it penetrates the consciousness at a very fundamental level, almost like doing improvisation. In so doing, Voltaire taps into that feeling of \"what else can happen?\" that overcomes us when we are at our most pessimistic. So, gradually you will find yourself identifying with the story -- even though nothing like this could ever happen to you. Like a good horror story, you are also relieved that you can read about others' troubles and can put your own into perspective. This last point is the fundamental humanity of the story. You see what a wonderful thing a kind word, a meal, or a helping hand can be. That will probably inspire you to offer those empathic actions more often.After you have finished Candide, I suggest that you ask yourself where complacency about your life and circumstances is costing you and those you care about the potential for more health, happiness, peace, and prosperity. Then take Voltaire's solution, and look around you for those who enjoy the most of those four wonderful attributes. What do those people think and do differently from you?

(It says so, in the \"about the author\" section in the back.) Of course, there are roughly a dozen more out now; Yarbro keeps getting new ideas for the character, beyond what she'd originally planned. This is unquestionably the best written of the first five books in the series, but be warned: do not read it unless you are in the mood for tragedy. It is powerfully written, and captures all too fully the trauma that struck all too frequently in that time and place; \"The Sound Of Music\" this most assuredly is NOT. (\"Hotel Transylvania\" was set in prerevolutionary France, \"The Palace\" in renaissance Italy in the time of Botticelli, \"Blood Games\" in imperial Rome at the time of Nero, and \"Path of the Eclipse\" during the Mongol invasion of China; this is set primarily in Germany during the period between the world wars.)There is little of the feel, all too evident in the first three books of the series, of the cheap Gothic Romance; the characters are very real, and so are the events (in at least two cases, a little TOO real for my taste, but I can't reasonably fault the author for that; the setting and period would not have been done justice had everything turned out well.)For those unfamiliar with the series, the Comte de Saint Germain is a vampire who has \"lived\" since approximately 1500 BC; he has many of the typical features of the stereotypical vampire; he doesn't age, is difficult to injure, and needs to drink blood to survive. But unlike the stereotype, he doesn't kill with his blood-drinking, and blood itself is not sufficient; there must be an emotional connection as well, and the less emotional connection there is, the less satisfying the blood is. He can be killed by severing the spine or destroying the brain; other wounds are painful, but ultimately superficial. He is susceptable to sunlight, but less so than many vampires; he doesn't care for it, but hardly bursts into flame on exposure. Essentially, he sunburns easily. Similarly, he cannot rest unless it is on his native soil, and cannot cross running water. All of these prohibitions, however, are alleviated by the expedient of wearing his native soil in the soles of his shoes, using it in the foundation of any home he builds, and filling his mattress with it, so he CAN, in fact, be seen in broad daylight in the Mediterranean summer on shipboard.The character is an unmitigated hero, not the antihero of most vampire fiction; wealthy, urbane, kind, generous, most worthy of emulation. Still, he's a bad man to cross. The series as a whole is highly recommended, and this book is powerfully written, if EXTREMELY unsettling.
