      "title": "Around Elvis",
      "author": "Robert Wells",
      "description": "A very different view of the world of Elvis Presley is presented in these comic fictional stories. His manager, Colonel Parker, his family and the Memphis Mafia all feature in episodes such as the siege of Graceland when the military police try to arrest Elvis. Fans of the King of Rock and Roll will learn of Liberace's hair-raising encounter with Elvis's pet chimpanzee, screen legend Greta Garbo coming out of retirement to make a film musical, and the invitation from HM The Queen to Elvis to attend the Royal Highland Games. Some stories are based on real events, such as the Million Dollar Quartet and being drafted into the army, but here they are given a comic twist. They are written by a lifelong fan who asks: Who'd have thought Elvis and life at Graceland could be so funny.",

The recommended book, 'Around Elvis', aligns with your genre interest, but it's categorized under 'Fiction / Fairy Tales, Folk Tales, Legends & Mythology'.
